# Bonding Curve Mechanism

Bonding curves determine token price based on supply.

## Pricing Formula

Currently:
```
Price = 1 ETH per token (flat, can evolve)
```

Future iterations may use:
```
Price = k * (Supply ^ exponent)
```

## Benefits

- Algorithmic control of supply
- Dynamic pricing
- Built-in incentive mechanics
